# particleQT

Check whether particle interactions of leptons, bosons and many hadrons satisfy the conservation of quantum numbers with a simply GUI-application.
The application allows for the selection for initial and final particles of an interaction, displays a nice \LaTeX representation (aswell as the copyable code) and 
shows and compares the quantum numbers.
I hope this application helps out for quickly checking the possibility of a particle decay/interaction and save time doing basic arithmatic ;-).

This is my first GUI application using Python and the PyQt6 module.
