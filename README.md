# particleQT

Check whether particle interactions of leptons, bosons and many hadrons satisfy the conservation of quantum numbers with a simply GUI-application.
The application allows for the selection for initial and final particles of an interaction, displays a nice $\LaTeX$ representation (aswell as the copyable expressions) and 
shows and compares the quantum numbers.
I hope this application helps out for quickly checking the possibility of a particle decay/interaction and save time doing basic arithmatic ;-). 

**As I do not have the time to continue this project I merged the updated GUI and the pop-up GUI to auto-complete the interactions. As seen in the screenshots below, the algorithm to find possible interactions is implemented in its most basic form as a console output. Whats missing is the display in the pop-up, the option to select one possibility and to import it into the main window.**

This is my first GUI application using Python and the PyQt6 module.
